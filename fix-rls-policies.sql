-- Fix RLS policies to allow user creation and management
-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own data" ON users;

-- Create new policies that allow user creation and management
CREATE POLICY "Allow user creation" ON users FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow user updates" ON users FOR UPDATE USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow user reads" ON users FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow user deletion" ON users FOR DELETE USING (true);

-- Also fix the debug endpoint access by allowing /api/debug routes
-- This is handled in the middleware, but let's make sure the policies are permissive enough
