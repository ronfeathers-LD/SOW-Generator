## Files Kept

### Essential Scripts
- `scripts/setup-admin.js` - Still useful for setting up admin users
- `scripts/update-salesforce-config.js` - Still useful for debugging Salesforce issues

### Migration Files
- `add-missing-columns.sql` - Comprehensive migration script (kept for documentation)
- `supabase-schema.sql` - Database schema (kept for reference)

### Documentation
- `CASE_MISMATCH_AUDIT.md` - Audit report of snake_case standardization (kept for reference)
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions
- `SALESFORCE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Salesforce integration guide
- `SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Migration guide

## Impact

**✅ Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 15+ unnecessary files that were created during development and debugging of the case mismatch issues.

**✅ Reduced Confusion**: Eliminated test files and scripts that were no longer relevant after the snake_case standardization.

**✅ Better Organization**: Kept only the essential files and scripts that are still needed for ongoing development and maintenance.

**✅ Smaller Repository**: Reduced repository size by removing obsolete backup files and test data.

## Current State

The codebase is now clean and contains only the necessary files for:
- Application functionality
- Essential development scripts
- Documentation
- Database schema and migrations

All case mismatch issues have been resolved, and the application is fully standardized to use snake_case throughout.
