## 🎯 How It Works

### Submission Flow
1. User submits SOW for review (`draft` → `in_review`)
2. System checks if SOW has PM hours (3+ products OR 100+ units)
3. Creates approval workflow:
   - **Always:** Professional Services, Sr. Leadership
   - **Conditional:** Project Management (only if PM hours exist)
4. First stage (Professional Services) becomes pending
5. Workflow displays to users

### Approval Flow
1. User with appropriate role can approve current stage
2. System moves to next stage automatically
3. Process repeats until all stages approved
4. SOW marked as `fully_approved`

### Rejection Flow
1. Any approver can reject with required comments
2. SOW returns to `draft` status
3. Author can revise and resubmit
4. Workflow restarts from beginning

## 🔍 Conditional PMO Routing

**The system intelligently routes SOWs:**

- **SOW with 2 products, 80 units** → 2-stage workflow
  - Professional Services ✓
  - Sr. Leadership ✓
  - **Skips:** Project Management

- **SOW with 4 products, 50 units** → 3-stage workflow
  - Professional Services ✓
  - Project Management ✓
  - Sr. Leadership ✓

- **SOW with 1 product, 150 units** → 3-stage workflow
  - Professional Services ✓
  - Project Management ✓
  - Sr. Leadership ✓

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Ready to Test
- [ ] Submit a small SOW (2 products) - should skip PMO
- [ ] Submit a large SOW (4 products) - should include PMO
- [ ] Test PS Manager approval (Stage 1)
- [ ] Test PMO approval (Stage 2, if applicable)
- [ ] Test Sr. Leadership approval (Final stage)
- [ ] Test rejection flow
- [ ] Test permissions (non-approvers can't approve)
