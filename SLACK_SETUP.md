## What Gets Notified

The Slack integration will send notifications for:

- **SOW Creation**: When a new SOW is created
- **Approval Actions**: When SOWs are approved, rejected, or skipped
- **Status Changes**: When SOW status changes
- **Approval Requests**: When someone needs to approve a SOW
- **NEW: @Mentions in Comments**: When users are @mentioned in SOW comments

## New: @Mention Functionality

### How It Works

1. **Users type @username** in SOW comments (e.g., `@john.doe Can you review this?`)
2. **System automatically looks up** the user in your Slack workspace
3. **Slack notification is sent** with @mentions to notify the users
4. **Mentioned users get notified** instantly in Slack

### NEW: Autocomplete Functionality

The system now includes **intelligent autocomplete** for @mentions:

- **Type @ to see suggestions** - Start typing `@` to see a dropdown of team members
- **Keyboard navigation** - Use arrow keys to navigate through suggestions
- **Smart filtering** - Suggestions filter as you type
- **User avatars** - See user initials and profile information
- **Multiple search fields** - Search by username, display name, or email

### Benefits

- **No manual configuration** - Users just type @username
- **Automatic user lookup** - System finds the right Slack user ID
- **Instant notifications** - Team members get notified immediately
- **Better collaboration** - No more missed comments or delayed responses
- **Enhanced UX** - Intuitive autocomplete makes mentioning easy

### Supported Formats

- `@username` - e.g., `@john.doe`
- `@user.name` - e.g., `@john.doe`
- `@user-name` - e.g., `@john-doe`
- Full email addresses also work

### Team Messages with Mentions

You can now send team messages with @mentions directly from the admin panel:

1. Go to Admin â†’ Slack
2. Use the "Send Team Message" section
3. Enter your message
4. Add Slack user IDs to mention (comma-separated)
5. Optionally add a title and channel override
6. Send the message

### Finding Slack User IDs

To mention users in Slack, you need their Slack user ID:

- **Right-click method**: Right-click on a user's name in Slack â†’ "Copy link" â†’ Extract the user ID from the URL
- **Profile method**: Go to user profile â†’ "More" â†’ "Copy member ID"

### Example Usage

```
Message: "Please review the latest SOW before the client meeting"
Mentions: U123456, U789012
Title: SOW Review Request
Channel: #sow-reviews
```

This will send: `@user1 @user2 Please review the latest SOW before the client meeting`

### Programmatic Usage

You can also use mentions programmatically in your code:

```typescript
import { getSlackService } from '@/lib/slack';
import { getTeamMentions, combineMentions } from '@/lib/slack-mention-utils';

const slackService = getSlackService();
if (slackService) {
  // Send to managers
  const managerMentions = getTeamMentions('MANAGERS');
  await slackService.sendTeamMessage(
    'Weekly review meeting starting in 5 minutes',
    managerMentions,
    '#meetings',
    'Meeting Reminder'
  );
  
  // Send urgent alert to entire team
  const allMentions = getTeamMentions('ALL_TEAM');
  await slackService.sendTeamMessage(
    'ðŸš¨ URGENT: System maintenance required',
    allMentions,
    '#alerts',
    'System Alert'
  );
}
```

## Notification Format

Notifications include:
- SOW title and client name
- Action taken (approve/reject/skip)
- Approver name
- Comments (if provided)
- Timestamps
- Direct links to review SOWs
- **User mentions** (when configured)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook URL Invalid**: Make sure the webhook URL is correct and starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`
2. **Channel Not Found**: Ensure the channel exists in your workspace
3. **Permission Denied**: Make sure the webhook has access to the specified channel
4. **Rate Limiting**: Slack has rate limits; if you're sending many notifications, they might be throttled
5. **User IDs Not Working**: Ensure you're using the correct Slack user ID format (U1234567890)

### Testing Mentions

1. **Go to your SOW Generator admin panel**
2. **Navigate to Admin â†’ Slack**
3. **Use the "Test @Mention User Lookup" section**
4. **Enter a username or email** (e.g., `ronfeathers` or `ron.feathers@company.com`)
5. **Click "Test Lookup"** to verify the system can find the user
6. **Check the results** - you should see the user's Slack information

**API Endpoint:** `/api/slack/lookup?username={username}`

**Note:** This endpoint requires admin authentication and will return user details from your Slack workspace.

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Team Roles

You can customize team mention groups in `src/lib/slack-mention-utils.ts`:

```typescript
export const TEAM_MENTIONS = {
  MANAGERS: ['U123456', 'U789012'],
  SALES_TEAM: ['U345678', 'U901234'],
  ENGINEERING: ['U567890', 'U123456'],
  // Add your own team structures
} as const;
```

### Integration with Existing Notifications

All existing Slack notification methods now support optional mentions:

```typescript
// Send approval notification with mentions
await slackService.sendApprovalNotification(
  sowId, sowTitle, clientName, stageName, approverName, 
  'approved', comments, ['U123456', 'U789012']
);

// Send status change with mentions
await slackService.sendStatusChangeNotification(
  sowId, sowTitle, clientName, oldStatus, newStatus, 
  changedBy, ['U123456']
);
```
